## Organization

This documentation structure ensures:
- **Reusability**: General docs can be referenced by any project
- **Clarity**: Clear separation between generic and project-specific content
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new projects without mixing concerns
- **Maintainability**: Each project manages its own documentation
