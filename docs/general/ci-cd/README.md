### Automated Checks
Every push and PR automatically runs:
- TypeScript compilation
- ESLint code quality
- Security audits
- Framework-specific checks (e.g., Expo Doctor)

### Branch Protection
Main branches should require all checks to pass before merging.

### Monitoring
Use `npm run push` to automatically monitor CI status after pushing changes.
