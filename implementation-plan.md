# Implementation Plan - Mila Shopping List App

## Current State Analysis

Based on the research documents:
- **Tech Stack**: Expo SDK 51, Supabase, NativeWind v2, Zustand + React Query
- **Design System**: Bolt Food style with green primary color (#34D186)
- **Architecture**: Feature-based folders, offline-first approach
- **Focus**: Stability over features, incremental development

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup (Today)

#### 1. Project Initialization
- Create Expo project with SDK 51 (NOT 52+)
- Configure TypeScript with strict mode
- Setup development build workflow

#### 2. Development Environment
- ESLint + Prettier configuration
- Pre-commit hooks with Husky
- VS Code settings for consistency

#### 3. Supabase Backend
- Create project via MCP tool
- Apply database schema migrations
- Configure Row Level Security policies

#### 4. Core Infrastructure
- Navigation structure (React Navigation v6)
- NativeWind v2 with Bolt theme
- Base component library

### Phase 2: Authentication Flow (Day 2-3)

#### 5. Auth Implementation
- Supabase Auth setup
- Secure token storage
- Biometric authentication optional
- Deep linking for password reset

#### 6. Auth Screens
- Login screen with Bolt styling
- Registration with family creation
- Forgot password flow
- Protected route handling

### Phase 3: Core Features (Day 4-7)

#### 7. Family Management
- Family CRUD operations
- Member management (humans & pets)
- Avatar upload functionality
- Role-based permissions

#### 8. Shopping Lists
- List creation and management
- Real-time sync between family members
- Offline queue system
- Category management

### Implementation Order

1. **Start with stable foundation** - No features until base works
2. **Test incrementally** - Both platforms after each feature
3. **Follow Bolt design** - Consistent UI from start
4. **Document issues** - Update troubleshooting.md as we go

## Key Technical Decisions

### Why Expo SDK 51 (not 52+)
- SDK 52 has experimental features (React Server Components)
- SDK 51 is battle-tested (May 2024 release)
- Proven stability with React Native 0.74.x

### Why Supabase over Firebase
- MCP tool available for automation
- PostgreSQL power for complex relations
- Better pricing for our use case
- TypeScript types auto-generation

### Why No MMKV
- Adds native dependency complexity
- AsyncStorage + SecureStore sufficient
- Simpler development build process
- Less potential for platform issues

## Development Checkpoints

### Daily Verification
```bash
# 1. Clean install test
rm -rf node_modules && npm install

# 2. Platform builds
npx expo run:ios
npx expo run:android

# 3. Type checking
npm run typecheck

# 4. Lint check
npm run lint
```

### Feature Complete Definition
- [ ] Works on iOS without errors
- [ ] Works on Android without errors
- [ ] Offline scenarios handled
- [ ] Loading states visible
- [ ] Error states user-friendly
- [ ] Performance < 300ms interactions

## Risk Mitigation

### Platform Parity
- Test EVERY feature on both platforms
- Use platform-agnostic libraries
- Avoid platform-specific code unless necessary

### Stability First
- No bleeding edge dependencies
- Lock exact versions in package.json
- Document every dependency choice
- Rollback immediately if issues arise

## Success Criteria

### Week 1 Goals
- âœ“ Research completed
- [ ] Working auth flow on both platforms
- [ ] Basic navigation structure
- [ ] Supabase integration verified
- [ ] Development builds working

### Technical Metrics
- App startup < 2 seconds
- Zero TypeScript errors
- Zero console warnings
- Both platforms building successfully

## Next Steps

1. **Initialize Expo project with SDK 51**
2. **Setup TypeScript and linting**
3. **Create Supabase project**
4. **Implement basic navigation**
5. **Create auth screens with Bolt styling**

Ready to begin implementation following this structured approach.
